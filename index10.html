            <h1> I am Ofentse Tyalimpi a third year gaming student at SAE Institute. Over my 2 and half years I gained a wealth of experiance from working in Unity and working in Blender. I am a hard worker who takes pride in his work and like making creative projects which have been 2D art and 3D art.</h1> 
            <h1> I am a person who believes that UI whether start screen or in game is such a crucial part to the experiance yet so many people do not take their care when designing this aspect of their video game, although i too fall for this ideollogally I want to do better and be more creative going foward.</h1>
            <h1> My 3D art is still not where I want it but i feel that i have the tools to take on any challenge and learn when needed to make something in 3D.</h1>
